### 36 - What's in an image (and what isn't)
- Its the application binaries and dependencias
- Metadata about the image data and how to run the image
- Official definition: "an image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container run time."
- Not a complete OS. No kernel, no kernel modules (drivers).
- Small as one file (your app binary) like a golang static binary.
- Big as Ubuntu distro with apt, and apache, php and more installed.
